# SMART_PARKING_SYSTEM
Conventionally, car parking systems do not have any intelligent monitoring 
system. Parking slots are monitored by human beings. All vehicles enter the 
parking area and time is wasted searching for parking slots. Sometimes it creates 
traffic congestion. The condition becomes worse when there are multiple parking lanes and each 
lane has multiple parking slots. The use of an automated system for car parking monitoring 
will reduce human efforts. Hence smart parking system is an IOT-based car monitoring system that if implemented properly will reduce human effort and help drivers know the empty parking slots and also this system makes it possible for easy way payment using RF Card reader, Arduino UNO; (https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Products),
Ultrasonic sensors, LCD Display, Ethernet module, Servo motor, transformer and rectifier.
